CodeSparks
==========

CodeSparks is the official J.Bean personal CodeIgniter template.

## TO INSTALL VANILLA SPARKS
Run this at your terminal (where test is the folder to install to and testsite is the domain)

    curl -L  https://github.com/JustinWUP/citemplate/raw/master/ci_install.sh | sh -s test testsite

## TO INSTALL WITH COMPASS (SASS)
Run this at your terminal (where test is the folder to install to and testsite is the domain)

    curl -L  https://github.com/JustinWUP/citemplate/raw/master/ci_install.sh | sh -s test testsite compass

Your site will be at ~/Sites/test and online at testsite.spark

## NOTES
This assumes you have Apache set up and Vhosts on. 
Also, Ruby if you're using Compass.
